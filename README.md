# Todo List

The [Todo List project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list) from the Javascript course in The Odin Project.

## Practice

- CSS transitions
- Modules
- webpack and npm
- Working in a code base for an extended period of time - because I added a decent amount of features and styling, this project took me a few weeks (on top of vacation and other life stuff).

## Future Work

- Make more mobile friendly (haven't learned media queries, etc. yet in the curriculum)
- There's a couple of minor UI bugs
  - Single tap on touchpad doesn't get project menu to appear vs. actually clicking
  - If editing a task and not changing the name, the edit task button stays disabled unless you trigger the event listener for input
- Remove task when completed (vs. just striked out) OR moving the completed tasks to the bottom of the list
- Display date if there is a due date (outside of the task details)
- Dynamic SVG for the icon next to Today that shows the day of the month
- Custom checkbox (colored based on priority, hover effect)
- Move task to another project using a button
